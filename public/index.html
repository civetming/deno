        <h1>OpenEDC Server</h1>
        <p>Your OpenEDC Server is configured and running. You can already sync data that you have locally captured on <a href="#" target="_blank">openedc.org</a> with it.</p>
        <p>However, to be able to work with the data, please move all files from the <a href="#" target="_blank">OpenEDC App repository</a> to the <i>/public</i> folder of your OpenEDC Server instance on your web server. Thereby, your OpenEDC Server will host the OpenEDC App and you can simply refresh this page to use the application.</p>
        <p>In a future version, it is intented that the server can automatically download all required files to this directory.</p>
